### Configuration
Socializer has a number of configuration options out-of-the-box. To configure how icons are displayed, go to the administration Configuration menu and find the Socializer link under Web Services. Furthermore, individual block classes may be configured in the block configuration and styled as usual.

Socializer includes two button styles to choose from (round and square). These styles can be overridden or you may use your own CSS class(es).

Here's what can be done from the global configuration menu:
- Enable/disable profile links or share buttons for the various social networks.
- Set the default style for link buttons or share buttons.
- Set the global Font Awesome icon for each networks.
- Set the links to your social network profiles. If left blank, the button will not appear in the spread.
- Set the share API link for each social network (where applicable, obviously). If left blank, the button will not appear in the spread.
